\begin{itemize}
  \item Want to compute. 
  Work with compactly generated $C \in \DGCAT_{cts}$ so that
  computations come down to compact generators and their homs.
  
  $\QCOH\,X$ compactly generated.
  But compact objects of $\QCOH\,X$ aren't preserved under
  pushforward of proper morphisms. 
  However, $\COH\, X$ is.
  So use $\INDCOH\,X$ to make $\COH\,X$ into the compact objects.
  \item Want to interpret rep theory in AG terms.
  In particular, induction of reps is \emph{left} adjoint to pullback.
  But pushforward for $\QCOH$ is \emph{right} adjoint to pullback.
  $\INDCOH$ fixes this.

  \item Integral transform for \emph{inf-schemes}.
  (Includes de Rham spaces, quotients by formal groupoids)

  \item Serre duality as self-duality of $\INDCOH\,X$,
  also for \emph{inf-schemes}.
  Explains classical Serre duality and duality for D-modules
  as same phenomenon.
\end{itemize}

Also, six functor formalism should be viewed from
perspective of correspondences.
