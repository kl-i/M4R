One of the main points of Gaitsgory-Rozenblyum is that
the assignment $X \rightsquigarrow \INDCOH\,X$ should be viewed
not as two functors $\INDCOH_* : \DSCH_\AFT \to \DGCAT_\CTS$ and
$\INDCOH^! : \DSCH_\AFT \to \DGCAT_\CTS$ but rather as a single
functor between \emph{$(\infty,2)$-categories} : 
\[
  \INDCOH : \CORR(\DSCH_\AFT)_{all, all}^{proper} \to \DGCAT_\CTS^{(\infty,2)}
\]
The precise construction of $\INDCOH$ in this form is
beyond the scope of this paper.
However, let us describe what this gives us
and leave the interested reader to find details in GR1, Ch 5.

IP : describe how correspondences encode
integral transforms, proper base change.
